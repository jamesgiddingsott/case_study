Case Study for Interview

Topic:
Inventory Optimisation 

Background:
XXXXX holds rotable  stock in our warehouses for planned and unplanned maintenance on our rental equipment.

The purpose of this case study is to determine, using the mock parameters provided below, the ideal level of stock required to support our fleet, while maximizing our return on capital. While holding an infinite number of components on the shelf would satisfy every foreseeable maintenance requirement, the components would not be utilized enough to justify the growing cost required to source and hold these components.

Objectives:
1)	Determine the recommended level of rotable stock required to fulfil 80% of demand in the 2023/24 financial year, while achieving 30% return on capital.
2)	Determine the average inventory balance over the 2023/24 financial year.
